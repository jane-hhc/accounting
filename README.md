## Problem statement

In our everyday lives, there are many expenses, such as entertainment, transportation and dining. It is important for us to monitor all the expenses and incomes all together, so as to have good financial management and wealth planning. When we are lacking of the information of the financial status, it is possible to spend over-budget.
